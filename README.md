Hello World!
============

Here it's a simple excersie that I did during this weekend to understand VueJS and show you my capacities.

The following app is a simple map editor for an adventure/rpg game. The goal is to get all keys to open the door and let the puss free!

You have 2 modes: **Edit Mode** and **Play Mode**.

**Edit Mode:** You can select a tile for draw over the map. Use the side menu to resize the map matrix. To change to play mode, press play button on the header.

**Play Mode:**

*   Use arrows or AWSD to control the puss! (Mobile compatible)
*   The puss needs to find all keys, Fnot just one!
*   Water hurts the puss, be aware you have only 3 lives!

Enjoy!
